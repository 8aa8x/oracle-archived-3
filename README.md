# Aces and Eights Oracle

An oracle that aims to be resilient and cross-chain.

## Core Beliefs

- `Fault tolerant` - The oracle should be able to recover from downtime, panics, and unexpected behavior.
- `Distributed` - Many instances of the oracle should be able to run simultaneously without duplication.
- `Pluggable` - It should be possible for anyone to create a new listener and responder easily.
